# Konnect MCP API migrations

Konnect's tool schemas are public API. This file records intentional argument
removals and the supported replacement workflow.

## Unreleased: tool input schemas are enforced at dispatch (patch release)

Konnect now compiles and caches every advertised Draft 2020-12 tool-input
schema and validates calls before invoking either a domain handler or a
meta-tool. A malformed present option no longer looks like omission and cannot
silently select the option's default.

Calls newly return a structured `invalid_argument` naming the failing field
when they contain a wrong JSON type, a fractional value for an integer field,
a declared out-of-range value, or an unknown property inside an object that
explicitly declares `additionalProperties: false`. Nested fields use paths such
as `components[0].unit` and `graphics[0].colour`. Objects without a closed
schema remain open; this change does not invent new restrictions that the
served schema does not declare.

JSON numbers `2` and `2.0` both satisfy an integer schema; `2.7` does not.
Omitted optional arguments and their existing defaults remain compatible.
`add_schematic_component`, `batch_place_components`, and `replace_component`
now declare `unit >= 1`. `add_hierarchical_sheet` and `edit_sheet` now declare
and directly enforce `width > 0` and `height > 0`; refusals occur before a
schematic write or child-file creation. Correct the named field and retry.

Tool authors now get an immediate failure while constructing the catalogue if
an advertised schema cannot compile. Catalogue conformance tests cover schema
compilation, cached reuse, closed nested objects and unions, declared bounds,
wrong-typed options, integer-number compatibility, and no-write-on-refusal.

## Unreleased: placement preserves library Value and Footprint (minor release)

`add_schematic_component`, every entry of `batch_place_components`, and
`add_power_symbol` now copy the resolved library symbol's `Value` and
`Footprint` onto the placed instance (#506). Previously, placement derived
`Value` from the name after `:` in `lib_id` and always wrote an empty
`Footprint`, even when the embedded library definition already carried both.
KiCad's netlister reads the instance fields and does not fall back to that
embedded definition, so the old result could have the wrong value and no
`(footprint …)` node downstream.

The single and batch placement schemas gain optional `footprint` arguments.
Explicit `value` and `footprint` values win over the library defaults. An
explicit empty `footprint` therefore clears a library assignment. A library
whose Footprint is genuinely empty, such as the generic `Device:R`, remains
empty. If a malformed library omits Value, the historical symbol-name fallback
is retained.

The placed-file readback now binds and verifies both effective fields. The new
optional arguments are backward compatible. Existing response field names are
unchanged, but their `Value` and `Footprint` contents now match the library
rather than Konnect's discarded defaults.

## Unreleased: Windows discovers KiCad's IPC endpoint (patch release)

No tool, argument, or response field changed shape. What changes on **Windows**
is which path a hybrid tool takes, and therefore the value it reports in
`source`.

NNG maps `ipc://` to a named pipe there, which has no filesystem presence, and
discovery probed the candidate path as a file — so it never found anything.
A Konnect launched by an MCP client with no `ipc_address` and no
`KICAD_API_SOCKET` reported the transport unreachable even with KiCad running,
and every hybrid tool took its direct-file fallback while KiCad held the board
open (#529). Discovery now looks the same path up in the pipe namespace.

For a Windows caller this means:

- Tools that reported `source: "file"` with a `fallback_reason` of
  `transport_unreachable` now report `source: "ipc"` when KiCad is running with
  the API server enabled, and their edits go through KiCad rather than to the
  saved file.
- Live-only tools (`update_pcb_from_schematic`, `refill_zones`, the routing
  tools) stop refusing and start working.
- `get_installation_info` reports the discovered endpoint instead of a null one.

Nothing changes on Linux or macOS, where discovery already worked, and nothing
changes for any caller that set the address explicitly. Discovery still only
ever runs at startup, so a server launched before KiCad stays unresolved for its
lifetime — see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## Unreleased: `check_clearance` says what it measures (minor release)

`check_clearance` returned the straight-line distance between two footprints'
placement anchors under a description that said "physical clearance". Read as
copper-to-copper spacing, a `21.125` answer stood in for a courtyard gap of
about 3 mm (#410). Footprint size and shape were never considered.

Stage 1 changes nothing about the number and everything about what the
response says it is:

- `measurement: "anchor_to_anchor"` and `anchor_distance_mm` are added; the
  latter is the value `distance_mm` carried.
- `distance_mm` is kept, identical, as a **deprecated** alias, listed in a new
  `deprecated_fields` array so a consumer can see it without reading prose. It
  will be removed by the stage-2 PR that adds a real physical-spacing mode.
- `note` states in words that this is not pad, trace or courtyard clearance.
- The tool description and the directory row no longer claim clearance, and
  point to `run_drc` for the question the old description implied.

No argument changed. This is `Part of #410`; the terminal change is stage 2.

## Unreleased: `update_pcb_from_schematic` reports an unassigned footprint (minor release)

`kicad-cli sch export netlist` writes no `(footprint …)` node for a symbol whose
`Footprint` property is empty, and the sync required one for every component.
One footprint-less symbol — a legitimate state for a generic `Device:R` whose
package has not been chosen yet, and until #506 every symbol Konnect itself
placed — failed the whole sync with *KiCad netlist node is missing footprint*,
naming no component and blocking every other one (#507).

Such a component is now **reported, not fatal**, the way eeschema's own Update
PCB dialog says "footprint not assigned" and continues:

- `coverage.unassigned_footprint` — a `{planned, applied}` count pair beside
  `skipped_by_flag`.
- top-level `unassigned_footprints` — one entry per component: `reference`,
  `value`, `lib_id` (from the export's `libsource`, when present), `symbol_path`,
  and `board_state`: `absent` (nothing is added; the part is not counted under
  `footprints_added`) or `kept` (a footprint with that identity or reference
  already exists on the board and is left exactly as it is — it is counted as
  matched, so it does not appear under `board_only_preserved`).
- A wired pin of such a component is dropped from the plan's net assignments,
  since there is no pad to carry it. Its saved `on_board` / `in_bom` flags
  still apply.

A schematic whose every component is unassigned is a `noop` that still names
them, and a genuine conflict still clears `changes` while keeping the list.

Both additions are additive; `status`, `changes`, `diagnostics` and every
existing count keep their names and meanings. No argument was renamed or
removed.

## Unreleased: IPC health responses say why KiCad did not answer (minor release)

`check_kicad_ui` and `open_project` gain an `ipc_failure` field (#532). It is
`{ "kind", "message" }` when a failure kind was established, where `kind` is
one of `not_configured`, `no_listener`, `access_denied`, `handshake_failed`,
`transport_error`, or `request_failed`. Before this, every one of those
surfaced only as `ipc_responsive: false` or `ipc_available: false`, so a KiCad
that was listening but refused this account looked exactly like one that was
closed.

`ipc_failure: null` means **no failure kind was established**. That happens in
two cases: the Ping succeeded with `AS_OK`, or `check_kicad_ui`'s own
`timeout_seconds` deadline expired before the Ping finished. The second case
still reports `timed_out: true`. A listener that accepts but never negotiates
takes NNG's 10-second limit to report `handshake_failed`, longer than the
default `timeout_seconds` of 5.

No existing field was removed or renamed. Two existing values change wording:

- `open_project`'s `message` for a KiCad that did not answer now depends on the
  kind. Before, every unanswered call returned "KiCad IPC is not reachable.
  Start KiCad and enable the IPC API, or work in file-only mode." That message
  is kept for `not_configured`, `no_listener`, and `transport_error`. The other
  three kinds return:
  - `access_denied`: "KiCad IPC refused this account. Konnect must run as the
    same operating-system user as KiCad; see ipc_failure."
  - `handshake_failed`: "A listener at the KiCad IPC address did not complete
    NNG's handshake, so it is probably not KiCad; see ipc_failure."
  - `request_failed`: "KiCad IPC received the request but did not answer with
    success; KiCad may still be starting. See ipc_failure."
- An IPC tool whose dial fails now says in its error text why the dial failed
  ("Nothing is listening there…", "…it refused this account…", "…did not
  complete NNG's handshake…"), instead of one sentence listing every possible
  cause. Callers classifying these errors by type are unaffected. Callers
  matching the old text must update.

## Unreleased: atomic validation for schematic edits (minor release)

`edit_schematic_component`, `add_component_annotation`, and
`group_components` now parse and semantically validate the exact prospective
command result before committing it. A missing UUID, wrong reference, unit,
library, hierarchy path, position, rotation, mirror, requested property, or
field-text placement returns `stale_target` while leaving the schematic
byte-for-byte unchanged. `edit_sheet`, `move_sheet`, `import_sheet_pins`,
`add_sheet_pin`, `edit_sheet_pin`, and `delete_sheet_pin` use the same contract:
their prospective document must contain exactly one sheet with the bound UUID
and its complete serialized state must match the edited intent. `delete_sheet`
must instead prove that the bound sheet UUID is absent. A mismatch refuses the
operation before writing.

Committed-file readback remains an independent backstop. If that second
observation cannot load the schematic or cannot prove the requested component
or hierarchy state, every tool listed above now returns the new structured
error kind `mutation_outcome_uncertain`, carrying `operation`, `path`, and
`reason`. The message explicitly says the file may have changed and must be
reloaded and inspected before retrying. It does not return `stale_target`,
because that kind is used for a pre-commit refusal whose no-write result has
been established.

No tool or argument was renamed or removed. The new error shape is an additive
public response change and is planned for the next minor release.

## Unreleased: mirrored schematic placement (minor release)

`add_schematic_component` and every entry of `batch_place_components` accept a
new optional `mirror`, and the schematic component responses gain two boolean
fields. Nothing is renamed or removed, and omitting `mirror` reproduces the
previous behaviour exactly: no `(mirror …)` token is written and the symbol is
placed upright.

`mirror` uses the file format's own vocabulary — `"x"`, `"y"` or `"none"`.
`"x"` negates screen-Y and `"y"` negates screen-X, which is eeschema's meaning
for the tokens it writes, and `"none"` is the explicit spelling of unmirrored,
which KiCad records by omitting the token rather than writing one. There is
deliberately no way to ask for both axes: KiCad stores at most one mirror flag
per symbol and reflecting both is rotation 180, so a pair of booleans would let
a caller request a state the format cannot hold. Mirroring is applied after
rotation, and it does not substitute for rotation 180 on a symbol whose pins
are not symmetric — 180 keeps every pin's coordinates correct but reverses
their visual order along the body.

Any other value is refused rather than dropped. `add_schematic_component`
returns `invalid_argument` naming `mirror` and writes nothing;
`batch_place_components` refuses only the offending entry, reporting it in
`errors` and placing the rest, as it already does for every other per-entry
problem. A caller who misspells the axis is asking for a reflection, so placing
the symbol upright and reporting success is the failure this argument exists to
end.

A placement's field anchors follow the mirror. `Reference` and `Value` are
positioned through the same transform as the symbol body, which previously
hardcoded an unmirrored frame, so a mirrored symbol's field text sat on its
unmirrored side (#101).

Responses add `mirror_x` and `mirror_y`, at the top level and in each `units[]`
entry, for every tool that shares the committed-file component readback:
`add_schematic_component`, `batch_place_components`, `add_power_symbol`,
`edit_schematic_component`, `move_schematic_component`,
`rotate_schematic_component` and `add_component_annotation`. Both are read from
the reparsed committed schematic beside `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `lib_id` and
`units[].field_placements` — never echoed from the request — and the requested
axis is bound as placement intent, so a reflection that did not reach the file
refuses with `stale_target` rather than reporting success. The mutations that
do not change a reflection bind the axis the file already carries, which makes
them assert they left an existing one alone; `add_power_symbol` binds none,
because a power symbol is placed upright.

No tool mirrors an already-placed symbol: changing a placement's reflection
still means deleting it and placing it again. This additive change is planned
for the next minor release; no tool or argument was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: DRC checks schematic parity on every run (minor release)

`run_drc`, `get_drc_violations`, `run_design_review`, `validate_for_manufacturing`
and `export_manufacturing_package` all run `kicad-cli pcb drc` through one
path, and that path never passed `--schematic-parity`. KiCad gates the parity
test behind that flag; without it, KiCad 10 still writes the `schematic_parity`
key as an *empty* array, so the parser from #245 read "never asked" as
"checked, none found" and every board reported parity `0` (#516). The flag is
now always sent.

Two visible consequences:

- **`schematic_parity` becomes non-zero on boards that reported `0`**, and the
  review and readiness verdicts that fold DRC in change on them. A board whose
  footprints disagree with its schematic — KiCad's own `ecc83` demo included —
  now reports `footprint_symbol_mismatch` / `missing_footprint` /
  `extra_footprint` items under `schematic_parity` and is no longer `READY` /
  `LOOKS GOOD` on that evidence.
- **`null` keeps meaning "not checked", and gains a reason.** With the flag on
  and no root schematic for the board's project, kicad-cli exits 0, prints
  *Failed to fetch schematic netlist for parity tests* to stderr, and writes an
  empty array — the same silent zero, one layer down. Konnect reads that
  statement and reports `schematic_parity: null`, lists it under
  `categories_not_reported`, and adds `schematic_parity_diagnostic` quoting
  KiCad's statement and naming the root schematic the test reads: the one
  sharing the board's file stem, i.e. the board's own project's root. A
  project of a different name beside the board is not consulted, because KiCad
  does not consult it either. A non-empty parity array is always kept as
  KiCad's evidence, whatever that lookup says. Review and manufacturing
  diagnostics carry the same reason.

`schematic_parity_diagnostic` is additive and absent when parity was checked
or when the kicad-cli never reported the category at all. No tool, argument, or
existing field was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: `add_mounting_hole` uses KiCad's shipped footprint names (minor release)

`add_mounting_hole` wrote `MountingHole:MountingHole_{drill:.1}mm`. KiCad 10
ships no plain `MountingHole_3.2mm` — 3.2 mm exists only as the M3 family — and
spells round sizes without a decimal (`MountingHole_3mm`), so the default call
and every integer size produced a name no stock KiCad resolves (#462).

The lib_id now comes from a table of the footprints KiCad 10 ships (`3.2` →
`MountingHole_3.2mm_M3`, `3` → `MountingHole_3mm`, `4.3` →
`MountingHole_4.3mm_M4`, …), and a drill with no shipped footprint is refused
with `invalid_argument` on `drill_diameter` listing the shipped sizes, before
anything is written. When `MountingHole.pretty` resolves from the machine
(project or global `fp-lib-table`, or a discovered install), the hole placed is
KiCad's own library footprint, as `place_component` would place it; otherwise
Konnect's unplated-hole geometry is written under the shipped name. That
geometry's pad now equals the drill (no `+0.5` annulus), matching KiCad's plain
`MountingHole_*` footprints.

Results add `geometry` (`"library"` or `"inline"`) and, for inline geometry,
`geometry_note`. The `footprint` field is now read back from the saved board
rather than repeated from the request. No tool or argument was renamed or
removed; `drill_diameter` keeps its default of 3.2.

## Unreleased: DRC item ownership (minor release)

`run_drc` and `get_drc_violations` now say what owns each item of each
violation. Every item in `violations`, `unconnected_items`, and
`schematic_parity` gains up to four additive fields:

- `ownership_status`: `resolved`, `uuid_missing`, `not_found`, `ambiguous`, or
  `unavailable`.
- `owner`: `{"kind":"board"}` or a footprint owner with its reference and UUID
  when resolved; `null` for every unresolved state.
- `item_kind`: the board node head when uniquely resolved.
- `layer`: the item's single layer when uniquely resolved.

Ownership is derived only from exact UUIDs in the saved `.kicad_pcb`; it is
never inferred from KiCad's prose. Duplicate UUIDs are `ambiguous` rather than
resolved according to file order. If the saved board cannot be reread or
parsed, every item is marked `unavailable` and the report adds
`ownership_diagnostic` with the reason, while retaining all original DRC
findings.

Footprint ownership does not make a finding false. Footprint-owned `Edge.Cuts`
is fabrication geometry; ownership identifies whether the board or footprint
definition is the likely repair location. KiCad's existing `description`,
`pos`, `uuid`, `severity`, and `rule` fields remain unchanged.

## Unreleased: `create_symbol` draws a symbol body (minor release)

`create_symbol` accepts `graphics`, an array of drawing primitives, at the top
level beside `pins` and per unit inside `units[]`. The vocabulary is
`set_footprint_graphics`'s — `line`, `arc`, `rect`, `circle`, `poly`, with points
as `{x, y}` and `stroke_width_mm` — generated for both tools by one function, so
the two domains cannot drift. Only `fill` differs: a symbol adds KiCad's pale
`background`, which is what the stock libraries use for a body box.
`set_footprint_graphics`'s own schema is unchanged.

**Whether the key is present is itself the contract, and `[]` is present.**
Omitting `graphics` keeps the existing behaviour exactly: the automatic body
rectangle is sized to the pin names, and pins are slid out to the edge it
computes. Supplying `graphics` suppresses that body for that unit — including
`graphics: []`, which asks for a symbol with no body at all and cannot be
expressed any other way. Supplying it also means pin `x`/`y` are written exactly
as given rather than moved, which is the reason the feature exists.

Two consequences follow for callers who combine `graphics` with older arguments:

- A `glyph` on a unit that also supplies `graphics` is not drawn; the response
  carries a warning saying so, rather than discarding the request silently.
- A triangular `glyph` (op-amp, buffer, inverter, schmitt) carrying power pins
  normally moves them to a generated rectangular power unit, because the
  triangle's apex has no room for their names. **With `graphics` supplied that
  split no longer happens**, since a body the caller drew has whatever room they
  gave it, and moving the pins would overwrite the coordinates they supplied. A
  caller relying on the split must omit `graphics` for that unit.

`units[].body` reports `"graphics"` when geometry was supplied, alongside the
existing `"rectangle"` and glyph names. No tool, argument, or existing response
field was renamed or removed.

**Four request shapes that previously returned success now fail**, because each
wrote something other than what was asked for:

| request | before | now |
|---|---|---|
| `rect`, `circle` or `poly` with no `fill` (schema-required) | `(fill (type none))` written | `invalid_argument` naming `graphics[i]` |
| any primitive carrying a key outside its schema | key ignored, the rest drawn | `invalid_argument` naming `graphics[i].<key>` |
| a pin with no numeric `x`/`y` in a unit supplying `graphics` | pin written at `(0 0)` | `invalid_argument` naming `units[i].pins[j].x` |
| `graphics` present but not an array | read as absent; automatic body and success | `invalid_argument` |

Nothing is written to the library file in any of those cases. Callers that
depended on the defaults must now send `fill`, drop the extra key, or supply the
pin coordinates. This additive argument and these refusals are planned for the
next minor release.

## Unreleased: `estimate_cost` and `validate_for_manufacturing` count copper structurally (minor release)

Both tools counted copper layers by finding the substring `signal)` in the
board text, which misses every `power`, `mixed` and `jumper` copper layer and
quoted a six-layer board as two-layer (#461). Both now read the `(layers …)`
table through the same function `get_board_info` uses, so the three tools
report one number for one file.

`estimate_cost` keeps its optional `layers` argument as the count to quote at.
Two additive response fields make an override visible instead of silent:
`board.board_copper_layers` (what the file declares) beside the existing
`board.copper_layers` (what was priced), and a top-level `warnings` array that
names the discrepancy when they differ, or states that the file declares no
copper layers at all. Omitting `layers` now prices at the board's declared
count rather than a substring count clamped to a minimum of two; a board with
no `(layers …)` table reports `0` and a warning rather than an invented `2`.
`validate_for_manufacturing`'s `board_info.copper_layers` changes value on any
board with non-`signal` copper; its shape is unchanged.
## Unreleased: schematic nets resolve by identity (minor release)

One electrical net can carry several names — a rail named by a `+3V3` power
symbol that also has a `VCC` label, a local label on a net that also carries a
global one — and KiCad nets a sheet by name as well as by wire, so two segments
each carrying a `SIG` label are one net. The shared net graph now joins
same-named points, and every audit compares net *identity* rather than a net
name. Where a name is reported it is the one KiCad's netlister would choose:
global label, then power symbol, then local label, then hierarchical label,
ties broken on the name ascending.

Two response shapes change meaning:

- `audit_power_rails.power_nets` lists one entry per **net**, named the way
  KiCad names it. It previously listed one entry per name, so a rail named by
  both a power symbol and a label appeared twice, as did a rail named by two
  power symbols on separate stubs. `summary`'s rail count follows. A consumer
  counting rails gets a smaller, truer number; one matching a specific string
  should match the KiCad name, since an alias may no longer appear.
- `get_connected_items.nets` is sorted and deduplicated, where it was in
  `HashSet` order. Its `labels` array now carries every label on the queried
  component's nets rather than only those spelling a net its winning way, and
  its `wires`/`connected_components` now include items on a net that carries no
  label at all, which were omitted entirely.

Two more tools change what they report, through the shared graph rather than
through any code of their own:

- `find_shorted_nets` keys off the same label-to-root relation, so a net
  carrying more than one name is now reported as a short. On a sheet where a
  rail is named by a power symbol and labelled for readability, that is a new
  finding per such net — five on this change's own fixture (`+3V3`/`ALT`/`VCC`,
  `RETURN`/`GND`, `SYS`/`+5V`/`PULLUP`, `AAA`/`ZZZ`, `MIX`/`MIX_H`), reported as
  one group per net rather than one per pair. It is the same condition KiCad's
  own ERC reports as `multiple_net_names`, and the tool description now says so.
- `points_on_net(name)` resolves the whole merged net, so `get_net_components`,
  `get_net_connections` and `count_net_connections` return the complete net for
  any name on it. Querying an alias — `VCC` on a rail KiCad calls `+3V3` —
  returns everything on that rail rather than the segment the alias sits on.

Findings change with them, in the direction of fewer false positives:
`audit_decoupling`, `audit_power_rails` and `audit_connections` no longer report
a decoupled rail as undecoupled, a rail twice, or a fitted pull-up as missing
when the capacitor or resistor sits on another segment of the same net. The
ground skips read every name on a rail, so a `GND` net that a global label
renames is skipped rather than reported as an undecoupled power rail.

`net_at`-backed reporting — `get_pin_net`, `get_component_nets`,
`trace_from_point`, `export_netlist_summary` — returns a stable name across
processes. For a net with one name the answer is unchanged; for a net with
several, callers that happened to see an alias now always see the KiCad name.

No tool, argument, or response field was renamed or removed. These changes are
planned for the next minor release.

## Unreleased: `find_single_pin_nets` counts pins, not labels (minor release)

`find_single_pin_nets` counted label instances per net name, so an ordinary net
— one label on a wire reaching two or more pins — was reported, and a genuine
single-pin net disappeared as soon as it carried a second label. Membership now
comes from the shared net graph: a net is reported when it reaches **at most one
pin**, zero included, since a label whose net reaches nothing is the orphan label
and the deleted-component stub the tool is sent looking for. Hierarchical sheet
pins count as pins; a power symbol's own pin does not, or the rail reaching
exactly one component pin would be hidden.

Every existing field remains with its existing meaning: `single_pin_net_count`,
and per net `net`, `x`, `y`, and `type`. `type` is still the kind of the *first*
label found, so a consumer matching on it is unaffected.

Results add five fields:

- `pin_count` — pins the net reaches, `0` or `1` for a reported net.
- `label_count` — label instances naming it, the value the old membership rule
  used. A net with no label at all is a different smell, so the count is kept.
- `pins` — the reached pin, as a one-or-zero-element array of the same
  `component_pin` / `sheet_pin` objects the other connectivity tools return.
- `label_types` — every distinct label kind naming the net, sorted. Local labels
  are extracted first, so a net carrying both a local and a global label reports
  `type: "NetLabel"` and says nothing about the global one; this field does.
- `cross_sheet_unverified` — true when any label naming the net can carry it off
  this sheet (global, hierarchical, or a power symbol). The answer is per sheet,
  and a flagged net is a lead rather than a finding. Such nets are still
  reported: a rail reaching one pin on this sheet is worth showing.

**`single_pin_net_count` changes meaning**: it now counts nets reaching at most
one actual pin, not nets named by exactly one label instance. A consumer reading
it as a defect count gets a smaller, truer number and needs no migration; one
that had learned to ignore this tool's noise can stop. No consumer can keep the
old set, since it was wrong in both directions.

No tool, argument, or existing response field was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: guarded PCB file fallback reports its observed reason

Hybrid PCB mutation tools may use their existing direct-file fallback when
KiCad IPC is unreachable or when a reachable KiCad positively reports that the
requested board is not open. A successful file-path result now includes
`fallback_reason.kind` (`transport_unreachable` or `board_not_open`) and
`fallback_reason.message`; its warning is derived from that same observation.
Existing `source: "file"` and operation-specific fields remain unchanged.

If KiCad answers but any relevant open PCB document identity is empty, bare,
malformed, unresolved, duplicated, or otherwise prevents a complete comparison,
the tool fails closed with structured error kind `ambiguous_open_board` and the
requested `path`. No IPC mutation or file mutation is attempted. Callers should
make KiCad's open documents identifiable, then retry; they must not treat this
error as permission to edit the saved file directly.

## Unreleased: `score_placement` reports interface filter caps (minor release)

`score_placement`'s decoupling deduction no longer fires on a capacitor placed on
a connector's own pins for cable/EMI filtering (#411). A cap beyond its value
family's limit from the nearest shared-net IC is exempted only when a `J*`
connector carries **every** net that cap carries and its courtyard edge is within
that same limit of the cap's center. The cap must be on the connector's face,
unless the connector's pads carrying those nets reach both copper faces — a
plated through-hole pin, not an SMD one.

Results add `interface_filter_caps`: one entry per exempted cap, with
`reference`, `value`, `connector`, `connector_distance_mm`, and `limit_mm`. It is
evidence rather than a score — an exempted cap deducts nothing, and a waiver that
vanished silently would be indistinguishable from a check that never ran. The
array is empty on boards without such caps.

No tool, argument, or existing response field was renamed or removed. This
additive response field is planned for the next minor release.

## Unreleased: type-safe trace deletion (minor release)

`delete_trace` now accepts only a UUID observed in the requested live board's
trace-segment inventory. Via, zone, graphic, footprint, missing, and stale UUIDs
return `stale_target` before `DeleteItems` is sent. A successful call reads the
same board again and refuses success if the segment remains.

The existing `deleted_uuid` field remains, but it is now derived from the
observed segment rather than echoed from the request. Results add
`deleted_type: "trace_segment"`, the observed net/layer/width/endpoints under
`preimage`, and `postcondition: "absent_from_trace_readback"`. No argument or
tool was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: schematic field text placement (minor release)

`edit_schematic_component` accepts two new optional arguments and returns one
new response field. Nothing is renamed or removed, and omitting both arguments
reproduces the previous behaviour exactly.

`field_placements` is an object keyed by field name — `Reference`, `Value`,
`Footprint`, or any custom property — whose entries each set any of `x`, `y`,
`rotation` and `hide`. An omitted member leaves that aspect as the committed
file holds it, so moving a field cannot change its visibility and hiding one
cannot move it. Coordinates are absolute schematic millimetres as KiCad stores
them, not offsets from the symbol body, and they are not snapped to the 1.27 mm
grid that component placement applies.

Because a field position is absolute it belongs to one placement, so `unit`
names which placed unit `field_placements` applies to. It is required when `x`
or `y` is given and the component has more than one placed unit; that request
is refused rather than writing one coordinate to every unit, which would stack
a multi-unit part's field text on a single point. `hide` and `rotation` without
a coordinate apply to every placed unit when `unit` is omitted.

Visibility is read in both forms KiCad writes: `(hide yes)` as a direct child
of the property, which is what `lib_symbols` definitions carry, and nested
inside the property's `(effects …)`, which is what KiCad writes on a placement.
Writes use the direct-child form; KiCad 10.0.6 treats the two identically.

`units[].field_placements` reports each field's `x`, `y`, `rotation` and `hide`
**as observed in the committed file**, not as requested, and is present for
every property carrying an `(at …)`. Every requested placement is first
compared against the prospective command result; a mismatch returns
`stale_target` without writing. The committed file is checked again before
success is reported. Failure of that second observation returns
`mutation_outcome_uncertain`, explicitly naming the file that may have changed.

A malformed existing placement is refused before anything is written.
`(at …)` is parsed positionally and must carry finite numeric x and y, and a
finite rotation when a third value is present; a placement with more values
than that is refused too. Previously an unparseable token was dropped and the
remaining values shifted left, so a rotation-only edit could commit a position
the file never held.

This additive change is planned for the next minor release; no tool or argument
was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: committed schematic component mutation readback (minor release)

Schematic component placement, batch placement, field edits and renames, moves,
rotations, annotations, and grouping now bind the selected symbol UUIDs before
writing and build their success responses from one reload of the committed
schematic. Existing response fields remain. Results add observed identity and
placement evidence including `schematic`, `reference`, `uuid`, `lib_id`,
`unit_count`, `units`, `fields`, coordinates, rotation, and instance paths or
references where applicable. Grouping returns the same evidence per component.

Success additionally requires every bound unit's observed unit number, library
ID, project/hierarchy paths, x/y, rotation, and property values to match the
preselected target plus the intended mutation. Placement compares requested
Reference/Value, library and unit, and its tool's coordinate rules (component
placement snaps to 1.27 mm; power placement retains requested coordinates).
Edits preserve the other bound values; moves preserve relative unit positions,
and rotations preserve relative unit angles. Coordinate/angle comparisons allow
only serialization rounding below 0.000001 mm/degrees.

Missing, malformed, stale-revision, or wrong-document identities refuse with
`stale_target`, including mismatched intended values, before edits,
annotations, or grouping are committed. Component-target
resolution and committed readback reject duplicate UUID, reference/unit,
property, or instance identities and conflicting project, instance-unit,
or cross-unit hierarchy records
with the new `ambiguous_target` kind and include their candidates whenever
Konnect cannot prove one top-level symbol per bound UUID and one logical
reference across its units. A post-commit verification failure from edits,
annotations, or grouping returns `mutation_outcome_uncertain`, so inspect and
reload the named schematic before retrying. A move commits the symbol placement
before a separate junction-reconciliation write; if that second write or final
readback refuses, the move can already be durable. This additive response
change is planned for the next minor release; no tool or argument was renamed
or removed.

## Unreleased: connectivity-safe component deletion (minor release)

`delete_schematic_component`, `batch_delete`, and
`batch_delete_schematic_components` now resolve a complete logical component
before writing, remove only no-connect markers owned exclusively by deleted
pins, and reconcile junctions only at affected pin endpoints. Wires and labels
remain, matching KiCad's plain-delete behavior. Selecting one placed-unit UUID
through `batch_delete` deletes every placed unit of that reference.

The existing single-delete fields (`deleted`, `deleted_units`) and batch fields
(`deleted_count`, `deleted`, `errors`) remain. Single-delete results add
`deleted_unit_uuids`, plus count-and-UUID evidence for removed no-connects and
added or pruned junctions. Batch results add `deleted_components` (including
each reference's observed unit count and UUIDs), `deleted_item_uuids`, and the
same connectivity evidence fields. These values come from reloading the
committed schematic rather than echoing requested selectors.

Missing, protected, malformed, stale, wrong-document, or editor-locked targets
refuse with `stale_target` before a write. Duplicate UUID or reference/unit
identities refuse with `ambiguous_target` when Konnect cannot prove a unique
safe deletion. A post-write readback
that still observes a selected reference or UUID also returns `stale_target`;
inspect and reload the saved schematic before retrying because that refusal can
follow a committed write. This additive response change is planned for the next
minor release; no tool or argument was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: complete schematic placement instances (minor release)

`add_schematic_component`, `batch_place_components`, and `add_power_symbol`
preserve every instance path when the saved root reuses a child schematic.
Existing inputs and response fields remain. Placement results now include
`schematic`, `project`, `instance_paths`, and observed symbol fields (`uuid`,
`added`, `reference`, `value`, `x`, `y`, `rotation`, `unit`). Batch results put
these fields in each `placed` entry; power placement retains `added_power` and
`junctions_added`. Values come from reloading the committed file.

Missing, foreign, duplicate, malformed, or obsolete saved instance paths,
references, or units return `stale_target` with `target` and `reason` before
placement writes. Repair the saved hierarchy and its complete symbol instance
metadata before retrying. Ambiguous
project ownership continues to use the existing `conflict` kind from #189.
If post-write readback cannot verify the target or symbol, `stale_target` may
follow a committed write: inspect/reload the file before retrying to avoid a
duplicate placement. This observes saved files only and does not claim an
atomic snapshot of the complete hierarchy or unsaved editor state.

See [Schematic project ownership](PROJECT_OWNERSHIP.md#placement-instance-validation)
for the acceptance matrix and limits. This additive response change is planned
for the next minor release; no tool or argument was renamed or removed.

## Unreleased: schematic ownership conflicts (minor release)

Symbol-loading operations and ERC root detection now refuse unproven or ambiguous
ancestor project ownership with the existing `conflict` kind. Previously, some
of these cases silently inherited unrelated libraries or treated the schematic
as projectless. `error.paths` names the schematic directory and every candidate
root. Restore the saved hierarchy or separate the independent document from the
unrelated project before retrying. Loose schematics with no candidate project
and adjacent library-table authority remain supported. See
[Schematic project ownership](PROJECT_OWNERSHIP.md) for the behavior and limits.

## Unreleased: Rust Specctra export is the default

`export_specctra_dsn.native_bridge_mode` now defaults to `disable`, so an
omitted value always selects the Rust/IPC exporter. This keeps the default path
free of Python and SWIG and makes its KiCad 11 direction explicit.

KiCad 10 users who deliberately want the authenticated ActionPlugin bridge can
pass `prefer` (use the native export when available, otherwise Rust) or
`require` (refuse when the native bridge is unavailable). No tool or argument
was removed.

## Unreleased: JLCPCB manufacturing files use vendor-ready names and schema

`export_manufacturing_package(fab_house="jlcpcb", include_assembly=true)` now
publishes `BOM-<project>.csv` and `CPL-<project>.csv` instead of `bom.csv` and
`positions.csv`. The CPL contains JLCPCB's documented `Designator`, `Mid X`,
`Mid Y`, `Layer`, and `Rotation` columns rather than KiCad's native position
headers. The existing `files_generated.type="pick_and_place"` discriminator is
unchanged.

JLCPCB assembly exports require `position_units="mm"`. Grouped BOM references
are individually enumerated and DNP parts are excluded from both the BOM and
CPL. A malformed CPL, compressed BOM range, or BOM/CPL designator mismatch
returns an incomplete/error result instead of an upload instruction. Generic
and other-fabricator exports retain the existing `bom.csv`/`positions.csv`
names, inclusion policy, and KiCad-native position schema.

JLCPCB CPL rotation and position corrections are now applied after KiCad's
native geometry export. The optional `jlcpcb_cpl_corrections_path` input points
to a versioned project JSON policy; exact designator overrides take precedence
over the first matching project footprint prefix, which takes precedence over
Konnect's independently verified built-in rules. See
[JLCPCB CPL corrections](JLCPCB_CPL_CORRECTIONS.md) for the policy schema.

The response adds `placement_orientation` at the top level and on the
`pick_and_place` artifact. It records policy provenance, each applied rule with
before/after values, and every unmatched footprint. Its status is always
`PREVIEW_REQUIRED` and `physical_validation` is always `false`: a structurally
complete package is not evidence that JLCPCB's selected component models are
physically aligned. Inspect every part in Component Placements before ordering.

## Unreleased: remove inputs that never affected an operation

The following optional inputs were advertised but never read by their handlers.
Keeping them would let a client believe a request was honoured when the result was
identical without it.

| Removed input | Migration |
|---|---|
| `import_sheet_pins.project_name` | Omit it. Importing hierarchical labels as sheet pins does not modify project-instance paths. |
| `refill_zones.zones` | Omit it. KiCad IPC refills every zone on the active board and exposes no per-net selector. |
| `run_drc.tests` | Omit it. `kicad-cli pcb drc` runs the complete configured ruleset. Configure rules/waivers in KiCad; `severity` and `limit` only filter Konnect's returned report. |
| `audit_decoupling.board` and `audit_decoupling.max_distance_mm` | Run `audit_decoupling(schematic)` for net-connectivity coverage, then use PCB placement/clearance inspection for physical capacitor distance. The audit never measured PCB distance. |
| `export_manufacturing_package.quantity` | Omit it from export. Manufacturing files are quantity-independent; pass `quantity` to `estimate_cost` for pricing context. |
| `validate_for_manufacturing.schematic` | Run the board validator without it. Use `check_bom_health(schematic)` for the separate schematic/BOM review. |
| `estimate_cost.schematic` | Omit it. The estimator counts placed board footprints, which are the components relevant to assembly pricing. |
| `move_connected.*` (all parameters) | The tool now refuses unconditionally: it never implemented the connected move and silently delegated to a plain symbol move while reporting connections preserved (#315). Use `move_schematic_component`, then re-route the affected nets. The parameters return when the wire-carrying move is actually built. |

These removals narrow the schema to behavior Konnect can verify. They do not change
the generated files or analysis because the removed values had no implementation.
